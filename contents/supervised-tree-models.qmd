## Random Forest, XGBoost, and More

### Random Forest

The random forest algorithm has been around since the 90s, and according to
Kaggle surveys, ...

### XGBoost

The XGBoost algorithm is slightly more recent.

### Other Tree-Based Models

Other models that use an ensemble of decision trees include gradient boosting.
This article below uses a gradient boosting machine (GBM) for time series
prediction.
