## History, Approaching Data Science Problems, and Other General Topics

### History of Data Science

While many of the elements of data science have been around for a long time
(even the idea of machine learning, AI, and the perceptron date back to the
1950s), the profession of data science / data scientist seems to have emerged
around 2008.

This first article below goes through the history of data science, including
its consituent parts - statistics, data analysis, machine learning, data
science tools.

*As a disclaimer, while most of the posts on this website are not connected to
the curator of this site, this is one post authored by myself.*

With two big components of modern data science being statistics and machine
learning, it is useful to think about the differences between the two,
especially to understand different peoplesâ€™ approach to a problem. The way a
statistician-by-training might approach a problem will likely be different than
the way a machine learning practitioner will approach that same problem.

### Rules-Based Engines to Machine Learning

Two articles below describe considerations when considering whether to
transition completely from a more traditional rules-based approach to machine
learning, or a combination of the two.

You can read about a recent, real-life use case from Netflix in the
[section on neural networks](supervised-neural-networks.qmd#real-life-use-cases-of-neural-networks).
