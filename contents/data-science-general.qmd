## History of Data Science, How to Approach Data Science Problems, and Other General Topics

### History of Data Science

The random forest algorithm has been around since the 90s, and according to
Kaggle surveys, ...

### Rules-Based Engines to Machine Learning

Other models that use an ensemble of decision trees include gradient boosting.
This article below uses a gradient boosting machine (GBM) for time series
prediction.

Two articles below describe considerations when considering whether to
transition completely from a more traditional rules-based approach to machine
learning, or a combination of the two.
