## MLOps Fundamentals for Data Scientists

MLOps is the practice of putting machine learning models into production. At
some companies, especially at small startups, this responsibility falls onto
the data scientist who created the model. In other, larger companies, there
are dedicated engineers who are responsible for this.

Either way, data scientists who are creating models that will end up in
production should be aware of some fundamentals of MLOps, and that is the focus
of this section.
