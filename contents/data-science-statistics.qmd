## Statistics Topics for Data Scientists

### General Topics

This first article is a paper by a statistics professor and a computer science
professor about what they consider to be the most important ideas in statistics

scientists, like regularization. This follows nicely from the previous page,
continuing to look at the connections between statistics and machine learning.
