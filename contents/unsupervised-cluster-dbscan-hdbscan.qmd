## Density-Based Clustering: DBSCAN, HDBSCAN

### Comparing k-Means and HDBSCAN

This post gives examples of different shaped clusters and looks at how k-Means
handles these. It then compares how the HDBSCAN algorithm handles these
different clustering scenarios. In general, HDBSCAN does quite well, even with
the default hyperparameters.

*Again, this is one of just a few posts on this site that is authored by
