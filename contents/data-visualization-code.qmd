## Data Visualization Code and Packages

### Code Examples to Improve Data Visualizations

What makes a good plot is certainly subjective, but there are considerations
that can make plots look more professional, as well as making them easier to
read. All posts in this section include real code examples.

The first post here promotes the idea of "less is more" in creating
visualizations, and even includes a gif that illustrates the effect of
simplifying a standard bar chart. This post has Python/matplotlib code.

This next example uses R code to produce visualizations of data that changes
with time. Some compare some metrics between two different time periods, while
there is also an example of a traditional time series line graph.
