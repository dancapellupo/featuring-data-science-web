## K-Means and Cluster Metrics

### Cluster Metrics

K-Means is probably the first algorithm that comes to mind when someone
mentions unsupervised learning or clustering.

One of the downsides of k-Means is that you need to determine how many clusters
there should be. One way to do this is to run k-Mean multiple times, with
different numbers of clusters, and use one of several metrics to determine
which is the best clustering.

This post goes through 4 different techniques / metrics for determining the
number of clusters.
