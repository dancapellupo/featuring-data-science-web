**My summary:**

This post is authored by a machine learning practitioner (Tom Fawcett) and a
statistician (Drew Hardin), so they bring their unique perspectives and draw
parallels and highlight differences between how ML practitioners and
statisticians approach problems.

Here are some highlights.

**Statistics**

> In statistics, the goal of modeling is **approximating** and then
> **understanding** the data-generating process, with the goal of answering the
> question you actually care about.

> [T]he Statistician is concerned primarily with model validity, accurate
> estimation of model parameters, and inference from the model. However,
> prediction of unseen data points, a major concern of Machine Learning, is
> less of a concern to the statistician. Statisticians have the techniques to
> do prediction, but these are just special cases of inference in general.

**Machine Learning**

> In Machine Learning, the predominant task is **predictive modeling**: the
> creation of models for the purpose of predicting labels of new examples.

> The model does not represent a belief about or a commitment to the data
> generation process. Its purpose is purely functional.

> ML practitioners are freed from worrying about difficult cases where
> assumptions are violated, yet the model may work anyway.
