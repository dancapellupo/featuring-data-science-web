**My summary:**

This post goes through several examples of using k-Means clustering, and four
different clustering metrics / techniques that can aide in choosing the best /
ideal number of clusters.

There is also [a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dancapellupo/featuring_data_blog/blob/master/clustering/clustering_part1_kmeans.ipynb)
available with all the code used for generating the examples in this blog post.

Here is the link again to their blog post for more details:
