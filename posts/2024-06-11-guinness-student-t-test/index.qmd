**My summary:**

What does beer have to do with statistical significance?

In this article from Scientific American, Jack Murtagh discusses the origins of
one of the most common tests of statistical significance, the t-test.

Around the start of the 20th century, Guinness wanted to improve the
consistency of their products as they continued to expand worldwide. So, they
hired a team to experiment and research how to improve their products.

One issue that kept coming up was small sample sizes. In other words, if they
are assessing the quality of hops, instead of testing every flower in a crop,
they wanted to test a small, random sample.

<!-- Then, comes the question of, if their quality metric does not match the desired
number, does this indicate that the entire crop is actually bad? Or, maybe they
were unlucky and this random sample that they picked out is bad, but the rest
of the crop is okay? -->

<!-- In comes the t-test, invented by William Sealy Gosset, the head experimental
brewer at Guinness. -->
Therefore, the head experimental brewer at Guinness, William Sealy Gosset,
invented the t-test.

<!-- Say we have some quality metric for this crop of hops, and we expect the value to be 8, but our random sample comes in at 6. If we assume that the full crop is normal, what is the probability that a random sample would have a value of 6, just by chance? -->

<!-- Typically, if this probability is less than 5%, we identify the difference between the desired metric of 8 and the measured value of 6 as being statistically significant. -->

If you need a review of the t-test and P-values, with some illustrations, take
a look at the article.

**Fun fact:** Gosset published under the pseudonym "Student", and therefore,
the t-test is often referred to as the Student's t-test, even today.
