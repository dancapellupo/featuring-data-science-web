**My summary:**

The post begins with some discussion of the principles of business logic.

About halfway down the page is a section entitled *Guidance for When to Use a
Rules Engine vs. Machine Learning*, which gives some of the general points to
consider for this question.

The next section, *Patterns for Using Machine Learning and Rules Engines
Together* gives some concrete ideas of how one might combine the two:

> Pattern 1: Leverage machine learning outputs as an input into rules

> Pattern 2: Leverage rule outputs as a feature input into machine learning
> models

> Pattern 3: Leverage both rule and machine learning outputs as inputs
