**My summary:**

For a field that has both 'data' and 'science' in its name, it may seem
out-of-place to bring in 'intuition'. But, as these blog posts point out, there
are times when intuition inevitably comes into play. So, it's important to
think about where we rely on intuition and how much we (should) rely on
intuition and in which contexts.

The [blog post from Harvard Business](https://www.harvardbusiness.org/data-and-intuition-good-decisions-need-both/)
is looking, not surprisingly, from the business side of things and how to make
decisions when the data is not always clear-cut or does not point clearly in
one direction or another.

The [post from Ryan Harter](https://blog.harterrt.com/data_intuition.html) is
focused more specifically on how to look at the results of a specific analysis.
He gives the following definition for *data intuition*:

> Data Intuition is a resilience to misleading data and analyses.

Essentially, we perform a certain analysis, but based on experience, have a
sense of whether something does not seem right and then double-check the steps
of, or the logic behind, the analysis.

To bring these ideas together, here is a bonus third
[blog post from Brandon Cosley](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-case-for-intuition-in-data-science-e1241e968a1e).
He breaks down intuition in different ways. For example, while data scientists
do not necessarily know how to derive from scratch all the algorthms that they
work with, they still have an *intuition* into how they work.

To recap, intuition comes into play throughout the data science process:

1. At the beginning of an analysis / project, one cannot realistically try
every statistical test or every ML model, so one must rely on some *intuition*
to decide where to start and to focus one's efforts.

2. Once you have results of an analysis or ML model, how do you determine when
you are done and have reliable results?

3. While the decision-making on the business side might come from a level above
the data science team, in any case, some intuition is likely to be relied upon
alongside the data analysis performed.
