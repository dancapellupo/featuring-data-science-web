**My summary:**

In fields such as retail, how do you incorporate relatively rare events like holidays into your time series forecasting?

As this blog post describes, you have a small fraction of the days of the year that are holidays, and each holiday can show very different behavior.

So, if you are training, say, a tree-based model, if you have a feature that says "is today a holiday?", that is not quite enough to get accurate results.

DoorDash is a food delivery company, and they could see in their historical data that demand drops off significantly more on Thanksgiving, then say on July 4th, compared to non-holiday days.

But, Thanksgiving only happens once a year, and how many years of training data do we have to train our model on?

And, the change in demand on holidays can also affect the model's predictions in the days after.

The team at DoorDash therefore took a cascade modeling approach. They train a gradient boosting machine (GBM) on a time series where the holiday effect has been removed.

They do so by first training linear regression models on the holiday data for each holiday in various locales across the country, where the target variable is the week-over-week change in orders on those holidays. This gives the effect of each holiday, which is used to get a time series with holiday effects removed.

Then, when making predictions, the holiday effect from the linear regression models can be applied to the results from the GBM when a holiday is happening.

Their results showed a decrease in the weighted mean percentage error (wMAPE) from 60-70% down to 10-20% around Christmas.

Another challenge is that if one wants to run an A/B test with a new model in a field like this, one would have to wait an entire year to cover each unique holiday. This team instead did A/B testing on just a couple holidays in a span of a month or so, combined with backtesting on historical data.

One last point is that the intuitiveness of this approach, training one model for "regular" days, and a separate one for holidays, makes it easier to convey to stakeholders and get their buy-in.
