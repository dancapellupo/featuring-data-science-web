**My summary:**

First, a definition: What is an MLOps engineer?

In short, an MLOps engineer is responsible for making data science / ML models work in production, and maintaining and monitoring these production models.

Mikiko Baseley transitioned from data scientist to MLOps engineer, so I think
her perspective is really useful for data scientists to hear, especially if we
have models that we want to move into production.

One point I want to highlight is from her point of view as an MLOps Engineer,
Mikiko lists 4 things that all data scientists should try to know and
understand [at 29:49]:

1. Version control (i.e. git)
2. Containerization and packaging strategies
3. Basic web technology and deployment patterns
4. Testing
