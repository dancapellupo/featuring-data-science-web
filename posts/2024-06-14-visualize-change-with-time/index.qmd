**My summary:**

In this blog post, the author presents some professional-looking plots, created
in R, some of them inspired by sources like the Wall Street Journal. The author
includes links to the R code for each plot.

While this post is on Medium, the author also points to their website,
[DataBrewer.co](https://www.databrewer.co/R/visualization/introduction), with
even more code and examples.
